## Student Instructions to clone the repository and how to submit the assignment:
------------------
* From your browser, go to [GITHUB URL](https://github.com/pkogge/Project1-TOC) and click the fork button as shown in the picture below


![fork_button](documentation/assets/fork_button.png "fork button")


* You will now enter the fork screen, from here make sure to select your own github account which is highlighted in screen below (for instance, I have selected my own personal account), after that click on the `create fork` button highlighted in orange arrow and box.

![fork_screen](documentation/assets/fork_screen.png "fork screen")

* You will now see the screen which looks like below, the first red box on left should reflect your own github account and should say forked from `forked from pkogge/Project1-TOC` then you can follow general instructions of cloning the github repository. Here is the [Docs Link](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) that help you to clone the github repository on your computer.

* Once you clone the repository open the project in the IDE of your choice.

### Getting started with the python support package manager "UV" installation
----------------

* start of by installing the `UV` in your machine here is the [instructions page](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#__tabbed_1_1) that helps you to install the `UV`.

* Immediately after installing it run command `uv sync` which installs the pytests and other required packages.

* NOTE: If you are struggling with installing `UV` please feel to reach me out via slack, I can help you navigate so. lvadnala@nd.edu

* This project template is equipped with all the packages required for your project. No additional python packages are required to be installed, but if you want to install additional python packages make sure use the command `uv add <python-package-name>`, mostly it is not useful.

### How can we run the code using UV
----------------
* for this project I am using UV to demonstrate to run the code, basically you need to use the command `uv run main.py` from root of the project folder in terminal to you would see your code executes.
* immediately after cloning the repository, and you didnt do any code changes, if you run the command `uv run main.py` you would see below results.

```
lax@Mac Project1-TOC % uv run main.py
Hello from project1_toc!
```

* the `Hello from project1_toc` message states that you are good to make changes to the code.

### Making changes to the code and running the test cases of your own
----------------

* Here is the folder structure that every student should make changes to.

```
.
|── src/
│   |── entrypoint.py
|-- results/
|   |-- SATu.cnf
|-- module_tests/
|   |-- test_sample.py
|-- main.py
```

* `src/entrypoint.py` file contains the function called as `main` where you have make sure to add all your files into the `src` folder and make sure use the `entrypoint.py` file's main function as main function. dont change this structure if not the automation wont be able to perform the grading.
* `results` folder this is where you should save your results from the project, the project is expected to generate `cnf` files which are basically the CSV files, make sure to save all the results generated by code to results folder (!!! This is most important otherwise you might loose points).
* `module_tests` this is the folder where you can add your own custom test cases, if you are familiar with pytests you can follow, otherwise it is not compulsion to add test cases to the project, its totally the students choice to add, since the pytests have a little learning curve.
* `main.py` please dont edit this file, this is the main file and it should stay like this.
* Once you add your own test cases please make sure to run the `uv run pytest -s` (optional step, should only perform this if you haev added test cases as per the pytest standard)


### Commit the code and make sure to raise the PR
---------------

* push the changes to the repositiory, here is the [Docs Link](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository) that helps you with basic git commands to push the code.
* Now the last step is to raise the PR to the Forked repo, here is the [Docs link](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
* please update the PR link to the Teams Spread Sheet Shared by Dr. Kogge, this is most important steps and we make sure to grade only the links that are part of the teams spreadsheet.
